# SwiftUI-HappyDays

This is "Happy Days", based on Paul Hudsons project in his book ["Advanced iOS Volume One"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/advanced-ios-1).
Checkout his website [hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) which has a lot of learning materials.


Happy Days: is an app that stores photos the user has selected, along with voice recordings recounting whatâ€™s in the picture.
To make it more interesting, it uses speech recognition to transcribe the user's voice recordings, then store that transcription in Core Spotlight.

And as I like SwiftUI, I'm rewriting the project using SwiftUI instead of UIKit.

## Current state of Happy Days

- Basic UI with search field and scrolling grid view to show the thumbnail of the memories
- Adding photos from the photo library using `UIImagePickerController`
