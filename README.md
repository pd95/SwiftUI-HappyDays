# SwiftUI-HappyDays

This is "Happy Days", based on Paul Hudsons project in his book ["Advanced iOS Volume One"](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/advanced-ios-1).
Checkout his website [hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) which has a lot of learning materials.


Happy Days: is an app that stores photos the user has selected, along with voice recordings recounting whatâ€™s in the picture.
To make it more interesting, it uses speech recognition to transcribe the user's voice recordings, then store that transcription in Core Spotlight.

And as I like SwiftUI, I've rewritten the project using SwiftUI instead of UIKit.

## Current state of Happy Days

Basic functionality of the project are implemented:

- Basic UI with search field and scrolling grid view to show the thumbnail of the memories
- Adding photos from the photo library using `UIImagePickerController`
- Recording audio for a memory by using a longpress gesture
- Speech recognition (automatically after recording audio): only in current app language, which is english!
- Search-ability using Core Spotlight

The overall state is still rather rough and not yet well implemented. 
The code in "Advanced iOS Volume One", is based on UIKit, Storyboards and MVC. I have tried to adapt it to SwiftUI and MVVM. There are a few usability issues.
